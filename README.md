# Development-logs-prototypes

Feedback and observation taken from the playtest of each game prototypes

Prototype #1: Jet prototype
Hypothesis: How comfotable is the manipulation of the camera fixed to the back of the plane(player)?

-The camera turn too quick for precise movement
-Hard to decipher where the player is heading when turing
-The size of the sandbox and objects makes it hard to determine the speed and placement of the player in the environment
-The shooting is off the aiming reticle
-Theaiming reticle takes a lot of space and block the vision when aiming precisly
-The bullets misses impact feedback when hitting

Prototype #2: Horror atmosphere
Hypothesis: What type of gameplay would best fit the created atmosphere/mood?

-Gloomy and mysterious mood (occured a lot)
-Desolated/abandoned mood
-Fear of the unknown: players where always thinking a scare would come
-Realistic render fit the mood greatly

-Escape room would go well
-Puzzle with gloomy atmosphere
-Crime/detective vibe to determine what happened before coming to the island
-Horror? (more of a gloomy vibe/uneasy feeling)
-Smooth survival
-Walking simulator/driven narrative (occured a lot)
-Collectathon in a creapy atmosphere (slender man like)

-Players where getting impatient when walking around, would jump a lot to pass the time
-Was looking to explore the other island for their landmarks (industries, lighthouse...)
-Often tried to look a way to get out (jumped onto the boat)
-Stressed because of the liberty to explore, too much ground to cover easily
-Lost orientation dure to the repitition of the landscape
-Players were jittery because of the high sensibility of the mouse
-Felt blocked because of the water
-Most where looking into corners to find hidden items
-Tried to run and felt held back without the option (occured a lot)
-Spammed the mouse click on itmes to interact (occured a lot)
-Most jumped in the water once they felt they had explored everything
-Attention was mostly focused on the observation tower

Prototype #3: Grappling platformer
Hypothesis: How does the mix of grappling hook and parjour create the sense of speed?

-1st obstacle block every player since it doesn't need the grapple hook
-Grapple lenght felt short for most
-Clunky movement when trying to change the direction while grappled
-Players had a hard time to swing from grapple to grapple
-Lot of momentum loss by hitting obstacles
-All got stuck on the sides of a platform since the lenght of the grappling hook cant be adjusted while grappled
-Hard to decipher the placement and speed of the player character due to the space skybox
-Bug when respawning while holding the grapple
-Low feedback from grappling and movement
-Tried to interact with the light placed (occured a lot)
-Tired of doing the same obstacles after respawning (checkpoints would help)
-Got stuck since couldn't move while crouching
-Player tought they could get to the earth since it was on the skybox
-Too easy since players could grapple to the base platform too

Remake prototype #1: ghost scanner
Hypothesis: Can the scanner be undestand and properly used to look for hidden items?

-Hard time uderstanding "Tab" was meant for the button press to use the scanner mechanic (thought it was the name of it)
-Scanner image is small and hard to read
-Scanner takes a big place on the screen since it stays
-Lack of feedback when able and picking up an item
-Lack of direction at the start of the game
-Got stuck on geometry (occured a lot)
-Tried to enter the big building
-Intuitive when the player understand it shows hidden items
-Thought the goal was ghost busting because of the name of the scanner
-Hidden item with big hitbox was hard to understand
-Blue tint of hidden items worked well to find them
-Bug when scanner only sees the terrain grass
